# QUBO Optimization with Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`QUBO1.ipynb`) demonstrating the formulation and solution of a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem — a key model in quantum computing and combinatorial optimization.

## Features

-  Formulate custom QUBO problems
-  Construct QUBO matrices for objective functions
-  Solve using quantum-inspired methods
-  Visualize problem structure or solution process

##  Background

**QUBO** is a mathematical model used to represent a wide range of optimization problems. It is commonly used in:

- Quantum Annealing (e.g., D-Wave)
- Combinatorial Optimization
- Portfolio Optimization
- Machine Learning
- Graph-based Problems (MaxCut, Set Packing)
